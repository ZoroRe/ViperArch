# ViperArch

An Android Sample Project use Viper Architecture.

### VIPER

- V -> View
- I -> Interactor
- P -> Presenter
- E -> Entity
- R -> Router

Viper just like MVP or MVVM, just split presenter to presenter, interactor and router, so the code is more modularization.
This VIPER are a litter different with normal viper, we use LiveData to contact View & Entity, so you change change UI easily after data change.

### Plugin
